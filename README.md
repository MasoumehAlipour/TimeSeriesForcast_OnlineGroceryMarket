**Predicting Future Supermarket Grocery Orders Using ARIMA Models in R**

There is an artificial dataset mimicking real-world retail online market data. Businesses rely on historical sales data to forecast future trends and make informed decisions. In the context of retail, these forecasts help predict sales volume and customer demand.

In this project I utilized an ARIMA model in R to forecast future sales within this market simulation. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is a predictive type statistical analysis method that can be used for forecasting time-series data such as predicting sales. ARIMA uses past values to predict future values; therefore, ARIMA uses time-series data. In this case the data set has a single row for each order and is daily, so the dataset is not time series data, I transformed dataset to time series to predict data by month.
